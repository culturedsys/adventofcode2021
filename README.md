Solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in OCaml. I'm learning OCaml, so the code may
be wildly unidiomatic. The main code for the solutions is in the `lib` directory
(one module per day). There's a folder per day containing two driver programs
one each for part 1 and part 2, along with a `README.md` with notes on that
day's solutions.
